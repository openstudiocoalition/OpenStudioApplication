# Important!
After the v1.0.0 final NREL software distribution (04/27/2020), the OpenStudio Application is now independently supported and maintained with open source contributions by The OpenStudio Coalition and members of the software community at the GitHub repository https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication. The NREL OpenStudio Application repository no longer accepts new issues or pull requests. Please submit new issues or enhancement requests in the new OpenStudio Coalition repository at https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/issues.

<a class="anchor" id="1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> To understand why the graphical user interfaces are being separated from the SDK, please refer to [A Shift in BTOâ€™s BEM Strategy: A New Future for the OpenStudio Application](https://www.openstudio.net/new-future-for-openstudio-application)*.

## What is the OpenStudio Software Development Kit (SDK)?

The **[OpenStudio SDK](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio)** is a cross-platform (Windows, Mac, and Linux) collection of software tools to support whole building energy modeling
using [EnergyPlus](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus) and advanced daylight analysis using [Radiance](https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/).
The **OpenStudio SDK** is an open source project to facilitate community development, extension, and private sector adoption. The **OpenStudio SDK** allows building researchers and software developers to quickly get started through its multiple entry levels, including access through C++, Ruby, and C#.
